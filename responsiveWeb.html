            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_monkey" target="_blank">Spider monkeys</a> have super long libs and tail,
            so when they walk they totally look like sipers! They live in the forests of Central and South America from south Mexico to Brasil.
            They live in groups mainly of 15-20 monkeys, rarely 30 or 40. Aproached by human they bark like a dog! (Such a silly goofballs haha) 
            They climb on the edge of branches and shake it to scare away potential predators.

            as some of them lives the furthes north of all the primats. Those that do live that far, where snow sits for many months,
            spend days in hot springs to keep themselfs warm. They live in groups where mainly females stay with usually one male leader, 
            and other males leave once they are sexualy mature. Male Japanese Macaque's venture alone, sometimes connecting with many different
            groups or just hanging around by themselfs or other venturing males.

            King colobus

        <img src="colobus.png" alt="colobus">
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_colobus" target="_blank">King colobus</a> also known as the western black-and-white colobus,
            is the westernmost species of the group on the continent of Africa. It lives in small groups consisting of 3 to 4 females and 1 to 3 males, plus their young. 
            These groups maintain distance from one another through territorial calling. 
            Groups rarely encounter other groups of the same species but when they do, males engage in aggressive displays. 
            Territorial calling is a common form of aggression but can also be a warning to the group of predators

            is an endangered primate in the gibbon family, Hylobatidae. 
            It is one of the better-known gibbons and is often kept in captivity.
            Family groups inhabit a firm territory, which they protect by warding off other gibbons with their calls. Each morning, the family gathers on the edge of its territory and begins a "great call",
            a duet between the breeding pair.
